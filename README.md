========

WinREPO - A custom tool created for those who needs to use repo on Windows!

Installer for Win-REPO is available on https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo. The final project will also be hosted once it is ready to be in a presentable open-source format.

Please file bugs on GitHub Issue Tracker at https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo/issues. All further updates and information will be available on the GitHub site.

Or leave feedback on my site at http://www.naresh.se/.

External Dependencies:
-----------------------------

1. Works with .NET 4.0 CLR - NOT Bundled with this installer. Please go to Microsoft.com and download the .NET 4.0 CLR if not already present on your machine. Windows 7 SP1 has .NET 4.0 CLR installed.

2. msysgit - The latest 'Git-1.8.5.2-preview20131230' has been packaged with the installer. Please install this when prompted and just go ahead without doing any customizations.

For convenience I have packaged the needed installers for the above SW in this installer. Install them as needed.

Please make sure that the proper options are Setup and you have clicked on Fix powershell and Fix SSH Config. This needs to be done only once. You will also get the git-bash front installed through which other tasks like git commit, etc. can be handled.

Win-REPO project was created in my free time and I will keep updating and maintaining it in my free time. As of now, the source code for the Win-Repo is hidden but once I have the proper headers and formats done, I will open source it under GPL v3.

Also keep visiting/star/subscribe to https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo to see when and what updates are happening. 

If you are interested in Contributing to the project, please feel free to drop me an email.
